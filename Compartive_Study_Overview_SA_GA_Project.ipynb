        "\n",
        "Most of us have been students at schools, lyceeums or universities and may have had our fair share of vendettas with the time schedule for classes that some might overlay with other activities. From the classic \"Friday afternoon shall be free\" to \"This class overlaps with another specialization\" complaint, and thus from simple concerns such as those here roots the University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP) [1]. UCTP is a task of assigning events of an university based on resource allocation: time slots, places(e.g. a classroom, laboratory, etc.) and the lectures themselves, while using other constranints. In the Master’s thesis', from Mälardalen University, report paper [1] it is stated that the constraints can be devided in two groups: soft and hard constraints, where hard are not to be violated, but strictly respected for a solution to be considered viable, where soft are extras that can improve the solution, more than welcome to do so, but there are no strict obligations towards soft constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "UCTP is considered to be a NP-hard combinatorial problem [1], meaning that there is no certitude that the solution can be found in polynomial time. Researchers have came with different proposals in solving them, though most of them are meta-heuristic algorithms such as: evolutionary algorithms and local search algorithms. Another factor that makes this problem hard to solve is that each university has their own requirements, making it an unique set of constraints for each university out there. Other methods include Ant Colony Algorithms, Hill Climbing, Quantum Genetic Evolutionary Algorithm, Adapted Flower Pollination Algorithm, to name a few out of the many [2].\n",
        "\n",
        "In this overview report, we aim to understand the UCTP problem and several of the named we dive into different methods used to solve the UCTP problem, that being the Literature Review section of this paper. This section will be the most consistent in size compared to the rest of this document. In addition, it will help us understand how the problem is formulated, how data is collected and applied to these algorithms.\n",

        "\n",
        "UCTP is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Before computers being used for such task, this problem was solved by hand. And that took an uncanny amount of time, and lacking the guarantee that the obtained solution was the best one. The focus is to allocate resources (rooms, lecturers and student groups) while minimizing constraint violations, such as avoid overlapping events for students [1].\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the complexity and constraint diversity of each institution, there is no general solution to satisfy them all. Therefore A. Scharef[1] formulates that UCTP can be devided in three main categories:\n",

        "  2. Course Timetabling\n",
        "  3. Examination Timetabling\n",
        "\n",
        "Where, school timetabling focuses on weekly schedulying for all classes of an education institution, with the main constraint of avoiding a teacher being in two classes at the same time. Course timetabling is adressed for the students, organizing the lectures where main priority is to avoid overlaping two courses happening at once. Examination Timetabling is once-in-a-moon organizational chart for examinations for students and lecutrers alike, where the main constraints are to avoid having two or more exams at the same time, or for the lecturers to oversee a single examination at once [1].\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Regarding constraints, there are two categories: soft constraints and hard constraints. Hard constraints uphold the priority, their meet is mandatory to obtain the optima slution. In the master's report documentation[1], there are three examples of hard constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A student group has **a single event** (i.e. a lecture) at a time\n",
        "- A lecturer attends **one lecture** at a time\n",
        "- A room has limited capacity, and it can not hold more students or instructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Soft constraints are the ideals that could improve the quality of a solution schedule even merrier, but they are not mandatory to be added. All hard constraints must be met first before having a soft constraint accepted. If some soft constraints are met, then the solution quality improves, otherwise the result would be yet feasible. Here are some examples listed from the same reference:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The last slot of the day shall be clear for the student\n",
        "- The pause/free time between courses shall not be that long\n",

        "As we work with constraints and with the encoding at our hands, a fitness function is used to evaluate the quality and feasiablity of a solution, by comparing it with other solutions. There are penalties for each violated constraint, where each violation has a value. The goal of UCTP is minimization, meaning that the fitness function converges to zero."

        "According to the Salman and Hanna[1], Simulated Annealing is a local search algorithm that can accept solutions that are worse during the search of the global optima for the sake of expanding exploration of the search space. It takes inspiration from the physical process of annealing in metallurgy - where a matrial is heated and then slowly cooled to remove imperfections and reach for a stable structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first reference [1], there is an interesting analogy that explains this in simple words: the heated metal is the solution and a temperature variable is used to simulate the heating process. In the initial phase, the temperature is set at a high value to allow the algorithm to accept worse solutions (the impurities in the metal), that avoids being blocked in local optima. The metal then is cooled down slowly, and the temperature value drops. From here the impurities are thrown out (the worse solutions accepted until the heating process has ended). This narrows down the search space and hopefully will reach the global optima (the metal with least impurity and a stable structure).\n",
